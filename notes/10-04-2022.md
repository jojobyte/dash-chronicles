## notes
- Bootstrap script at https://github.com/dashameter/dash-dapp-bootstrap/blob/master/setup/1-setup-node-npm-docker-compose-mn-boostrap.sh uses Node v12 which has reached end of life in many platforms. Might need to be upgraded
- MN Bootstrap is out of date, may need update to https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/dashmate
- https://github.com/dashameter/dashpay-wallet
	- Needs better documentations and descriptions for what the project does
	- It's likely the mobile-only app built in Ionic
- https://github.com/dashameter/dash-dapp-scaffold
	- Also needs better documentation and a description
	- Likely the Desktop/Web version of the app
- https://github.com/dashameter/dash-dapp-bootstrap
	- Looks like its sets up the required testing environment for local development
